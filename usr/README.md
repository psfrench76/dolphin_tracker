The usr directory is for user configurations, 
namely a user-specific user_settings.yaml file. Any settings in the
user_settings.yaml file will override the default settings in the
settings.yaml file. The user_settings.yaml file is not stored in the
repository, so it will not be overridden by updates. Only settings
which are specifically desired to be overridden should be included in
the user_settings.yaml file.
